df <- bq_project_query(project_id, query) %>% bq_table_download()

# ggplot2 likes a date for timeseries
df_tf <- df %>%

NB: As of ggplot 3.2.0, you must have the `group` aesthetic for boxplots manually specifying the bounds. (https://stackoverflow.com/q/57192727)

```{r}
plot <-
  ggplot(df_tf,
         aes(
           x = date,
           ymin = q_5,
           lower = q_25,
           middle = q_50,
           upper = q_75,
           ymax = q_95,
           group = date,
           fill = year_factor
         )) +
  geom_boxplot(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_hue(l=50, guide=F) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = '1 year', date_labels = "%Y") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks(6)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Flight Times of Flights From SFO → SEA, by Month",
    subtitle = "via US DoT. Box bounds are 25th/75th quantiles, whiskers are 5th/95th quantiles.",
    y = 'Total Elapsed Flight Time (Minutes)',
    fill = '',
    caption = 'Max Woolf — minimaxir.com'
  ) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())

Alternate approach using ribbons (not used in final blog post since harder to visually parse, but present here for posterity):

```{r}

  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = q_25, ymax = q_75), alpha=0.3, size=0, stat = "identity") +
  geom_line(aes(y = q_50), stat = "identity") +
  scale_color_hue(l=50, guide=F) +
  scale_fill_hue(l=50, guide=F) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = '1 year', date_labels = "%Y") +
